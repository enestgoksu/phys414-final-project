## Overview

This repository contains the computational notebooks and final report for the
PHYS414/514 Final Project on stellar structure.

The project studies compact stars using:

- Newtonian gravity (white dwarfs)
- General Relativity (TOV equations for neutron stars)

---

## Contents

- `notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebooks used for all calculations and figures  
  (Newton and Einstein parts)

- `figures/`  
  Figures generated from the notebooks and used in the report

- `data/`  
  Input data (white dwarf observational data)

- `report/`  
  Final project report (PDF)

---

## Notes

- Newtonian calculations are performed in CGS units.
- Einstein (TOV) calculations use geometrized units.
- All figures in the report are reproducible from the notebooks.
